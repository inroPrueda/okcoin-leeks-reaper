## Method 1: Check Your Email
 
When you purchased Eset Nod32 Antivirus 404170, you should have received an email from Eset with your license key, username and password. The username and password are different from the license key, which is used to activate the product. The username and password are used to access the program settings and to contact technical support. If you still have the email from Eset, you can find your username and password there.
 
## Method 2: Use the Eset Unlock Utility
 
If you do not have the email from Eset, or if you have changed your email address, you can use the Eset Unlock Utility to generate an unlock code that will allow you to reset your password. To use the Eset Unlock Utility, follow these steps:
 
1. Download the Eset Unlock Utility from [this link](https://support.eset.com/en/kb2822-locate-my-eset-username-in-the-program-settings-to-contact-technical-support) and save it to your desktop.
2. Double-click the file named unlock.exe. A window will appear with a numeric unlock ID. If you are using Windows Vista or later, you must right-click the file and select Run as Administrator.
3. Contact Eset Technical Support by submitting a support request [here](https://www.eset.com/us/support/contact/). Include the unlock ID that you generated in step 2, as well as your license key that was sent to you after purchase. You can also provide your old email address if you have it.
4. You will receive an email from Eset Technical Support with a unique case number and an unlock code. The unlock code will be located at the top of the email following the sentence "Below is the unlock code you requested".
5. Run the Eset Unlock Utility again and enter the numeric unlock code provided by Eset Technical Support into the Enter Code field. Click OK.
6. You will see a message that says "Password successfully reset". Click OK.
7. Open your Eset Nod32 Antivirus 404170 program and click Help and Support. You will see your username and password in the License details window.

## Method 3: Use the Lost License Page
 
If you do not have access to your email or if you do not want to use the Eset Unlock Utility, you can use the Lost License page on the Eset website to recover your username and password. To use the Lost License page, follow these steps:

1. Go to [this link](https://www.eset.com/us/support/lost-license/) and enter your license key or registered email address in the appropriate field. Click Submit.
2. You will receive an email from Eset with your username and password. If you do not see the email in your inbox, check your spam or junk folder.
3. Open your Eset Nod32 Antivirus 404170 program and click Help and Support. You will see your username and password in the License details window.

In this article, we have shown you how to find your Eset Nod32 Antivirus 404170 username and password in three different ways: by checking your email, by using the Eset Unlock Utility, or by using the Lost License page.
